# Final-Year-Project

We are trying to create a universal assistant for testers. It will make the exploratory testing process more efficient in the industry. Since we are using machine learning in the creation of this tool we are limited to a single domain. The domain we will be focusing on is e-commerce websites.

How to Run code:

1) You need an open source E-commerce Website. (You can use given Shopping website in the Folder).
2) Open Flask Server Folder
3) Run ngram model file in vs Code.
4) The Folder named as Extension (Prediction). You can see Borderify.js file.
5) Open Mozilla/Chrome or any browser and load borderify.js as a temporary extension.
6) Now open Xamp server and start services.
7) Then load E-commerce site on local host.
8) The extension will give predictions on the website..
